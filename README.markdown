# LetsNode.com

This blog **is about node.js** and the cool stuff you can do with it.

This blog is based on [howtonode][]. Howtonode's source code is available on [howtonode's github repository][]

The source code of this blog is also available on [letsnode's github repository]. I pretty much added the [Twitter BootStrap CSS library] to the blog 

I will be posting here experiences and code of real projects I am developing by using node.js, express.js and NoSql databases like redis.

Hope you also enjoy working with node as I do..
